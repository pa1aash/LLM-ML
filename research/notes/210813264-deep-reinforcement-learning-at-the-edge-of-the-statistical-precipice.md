Abstract:
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the field.

Abstract
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by com-
paring their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results
on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such
as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied
by the use of a ﬁnite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning
Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has
led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating
the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable
evaluation in the few-run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results
without running the risk of slowing down progress in the ﬁeld. We illustrate this
point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we ﬁnd substantial
discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more
thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the ﬁeld’s conﬁdence in
reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval esti-
mates of aggregate performance and propose performance proﬁles to account for
the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efﬁcient aggregate
metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results.
Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing
algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and
the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons.
Our ﬁndings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for
which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an
open-source library rliable2, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the ﬁeld.

Introduction
Research in artiﬁcial intelligence, and particularly deep reinforcement learning (RL), relies on
evaluating aggregate performance on a diverse suite of tasks to assess progress. Quantitative
evaluation on a suite of tasks, such as Atari games [5], reveals strengths and limitations of methods
while simultaneously guiding researchers towards methods with promising results. Performance of
RL algorithms is usually summarized with a point estimate of task performance measure, such as
mean and median performance across tasks, aggregated over independent training runs.
A small number of training runs (Figure 1) coupled with high variability in performance of deep
RL algorithms [16, 17, 41, 68, 70], often leads to substantial statistical uncertainty in reported point

estimates. While evaluating more runs per task has been prescribed to reduce uncertainty and obtain
reliable estimates [20, 41, 49], 3-10 runs are prevalent in deep RL as it is often computationally
prohibitive to evaluate more runs. For example, 5 runs each on 50+ Atari 2600 games in ALE using
standard protocol requires more than 1000 GPU training days [15]. As we move towards more
challenging and complex RL benchmarks (e.g., StarCraft [110]), evaluating more than a handful
of runs will become increasingly demanding due to increased amount of compute and data needed
to tackle such tasks. Additional confounding factors, such as exploration in the low-data regime,
exacerbates the performance variability in deep RL – as seen on the Atari 100k benchmark [50] –
often requiring many more runs to achieve negligible statistical uncertainty in reported estimates.

Ignoring the statistical uncertainty in deep RL
results gives a false impression of fast scien-
tiﬁc progress in the ﬁeld. It inevitably evades
the question: “Would similar ﬁndings be ob-
tained with new independent runs under differ-
ent random conditions?” This could steer re-
searchers towards superﬁcially beneﬁcial meth-
ods [11, 12, 25], often at the expense of bet-
ter methods being neglected or even rejected
early [67, 74] as such methods fail to outper-
form inferior methods simply due to less fa-
vorable random conditions. Furthermore, only
reporting point estimates obscures nuances in
comparisons [85] and can erroneously lead the
ﬁeld to conclude which methods are state-of-
the-art [63, 84], ensuing wasted effort when
applied in practice [108]. Moreover, not report-
ing the uncertainty in deep RL results makes them difﬁcult to reproduce except under the exact same
random conditions, which could lead to a reproducibility crisis similar to the one that plagues other
ﬁelds [4, 44, 78]. Finally, unreliable results could erode trust in deep RL research itself [45].
In this work, we show that recent deep RL papers compare unreliable point estimates, which are
dominated by statistical uncertainty, as well as exploit non-standard evaluation protocols, using a
case study on Atari 100k (Section 3). Then, we illustrate how to reliably evaluate performance with
only a handful of runs using a more rigorous evaluation methodology that accounts for uncertainty
in results (Section 4). To exemplify the necessity of such methodology, we scrutinize performance
evaluations of existing algorithms on widely used benchmarks, including the ALE [5] (Atari 100k,
Atari 200M), Procgen [18] and DeepMind Control Suite [104], again revealing discrepancies in prior
comparisons (Section 5). Our ﬁndings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL,
for which we present a better methodology to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the ﬁeld.
How do we reliably evaluate performance on deep RL benchmarks with only a handful of runs?
As a practical solution that is easily applicable with 3-10 runs per task, we identify three statistical
tools (Table 1) for improving the quality of experimental reporting. Since any performance estimate
based on a ﬁnite number of runs is a random variable, we argue that it should be treated as such.
Speciﬁcally, we argue for reporting aggregate performance measures using interval estimates via
stratiﬁed bootstrap conﬁdence intervals, as opposed to point estimates. Among prevalent aggregate
measures, mean can be easily dominated by performance on a few outlier tasks, while median has
high variability and zero performance on nearly half of the tasks does not change it. To address these
deﬁciencies, we present more efﬁcient and robust alternatives, such as interquartile mean, which are
not unduly affected by outliers and have small uncertainty even with a handful of runs. Furthermore,
to reveal the variability in performance across tasks, we propose reporting performance distributions
across all runs. Compared to prior work [5, 83], these distributions result in performance proﬁles [26]
that are statistically unbiased, more robust to outliers, and require fewer runs for smaller uncertainty.

Formalism
We consider the setting in which a reinforcement learning algorithm is evaluated on M tasks. For
each of these tasks, we perform N independent runs3 which each provide a scalar, normalized score
3A run can be different from using a ﬁxed random seed. Indeed, ﬁxing the seed may not be able to control all
sources of randomness such as non-determinism of ML frameworks with GPUs (e.g., Figure A.13).

xm,n, m = 1, . . . , M and n = 1, . . . , N. These normalized scores are obtained by linearly rescaling
per-task scores4 based on two reference points; for example, performance on the Atari games is
typically normalized with respect to a random agent and an average human, who are assigned a
normalized score of 0 and 1 respectively [75]. We denote the set of normalized scores by x1:M,1:N.
In most experiments, there is inherent randomness in the scores obtained from different runs. This
randomness can arise from stochasticity in the task, exploratory choices made during learning, ran-
domized initial parameters, but also software and hardware considerations such as non-determinism
in GPUs and in machine learning frameworks [116]. Thus, we model the algorithm’s normalized
score on the mth task as a real-valued random variable Xm. Then, the score xm,n is a realization
of the random variable Xm,n, which is identically distributed as Xm. For τ ∈R, we deﬁne the
tail distribution function of Xm as Fm(τ) = P(Xm > τ). For any collection of scores y1:K, the
empirical tail distribution function is given by ˆF(τ; y1:K) = 1
K
PK
k=1 1[yk > τ]. In particular, we
write ˆFm(τ) = ˆF(τ; xm,1:N).
The aggregate performance of an algorithm maps the set of normalized scores x1:M,1:N to a scalar
value. Two prevalent aggregate performance metrics are the mean and median normalized scores. If
we denote by ¯xm = 1
N
PN
n=1 xm,n the average score on task m across N runs, then these aggregate
metrics are Mean(¯x1:M) and Median(¯x1:M). More precisely, we call these sample mean and sample
median over the task means since they are computed from a ﬁnite set of N runs. Since ¯xm is a
realization of the random variable ¯Xm = 1
N
PN
n=1 Xm,n, the sample mean and median scores are
point estimates of the random variables Mean( ¯X1:M) and Median( ¯X1:M) respectively. We call true
mean and true median the metrics that would be obtained if we had unlimited experimental capacity
(N →∞), given by Mean(E[X1:M]) and Median(E[X1:M]) respectively.
Conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for a ﬁnite-sample score can be interpreted as an estimate of plausible
values for the true score. A α × 100% CI computes an interval such that if we rerun the experiment
and construct the CI using a different set of runs, the fraction of calculated CIs (which would differ
for each set of runs) that contain the true score would tend towards α × 100%, where α ∈[0, 1] is
the nominal coverage rate. 95% CIs are typically used in practice. If the true score lies outside the
95% CI, then a sampling event has occurred which had a probability of 5% of happening by chance.

subsampled uniformly with replacement from 100 runs. For a given algorithm, the sampling distribution shows
the variation in the median scores when re-estimated using a different set of runs. The reported point estimates
of median in publications, as shown by dashed lines, do not provide any information about the variability in
median scores and severely overestimate or underestimate the expected median. We use the same number of
runs as reported by publications: N = 5 runs for DER, OTR and DrQ, N = 10 runs for SPR and N = 20 runs
for CURL. Right. 95% CIs for median and IQM scores (Section 4.3) for varying N. There is a substantial
uncertainty in median scores even with 50 runs. IQM has much smaller CIs than median. Note that when CIs
overlap, properly accounting for uncertainty entails computing CIs for score differences (Figure A.15).
Remark. Following Amrhein et al. [2], Romer [87], Wasserstein et al. [112], we recommend using
conﬁdence intervals for measuring the uncertainty in results and showing effect sizes (e.g., per-
formance improvements over baseline) that are compatible with the given data. Furthermore, we
emphasize using statistical thinking but avoid statistical signiﬁcance tests (e.g., p-value < 0.05)
because of their dichotomous nature (signiﬁcant vs. not signiﬁcant) and common misinterpreta-
tions [33, 35, 73] such as 1) lack of statistically signiﬁcant results does not demonstrate the absence
of effect (Figure 2, right), and 2) given enough data, any trivial effect can be statistically signiﬁcant
but may not be practically signiﬁcant.

Case Study: The Atari 100k benchmark
We begin with a case study to illustrate the pitfalls arising from the naïve use of point estimates in the
few-run regime. Our case study concerns the Atari 100k benchmark [50], an offshoot of the ALE
for evaluating data-efﬁciency in deep RL. In this benchmark, algorithms are evaluated on only 100k
steps (2-3 hours of game-play) for each of its 26 games, versus 200M frames in the ALE benchmark.
Prior reported results on this benchmark have been computed mostly from 3 [39, 55, 59, 72, 89, 95]
or 5 runs [50, 51, 53, 54, 64, 66, 86, 107, 115], and more rarely, 10 [65, 93] or 20 runs [56].
Our case study compares the performance of ﬁve recent deep RL algorithms, namely: (1) DER [107]
and (2) OTR [51], (3) DrQ5 [53], (4) CURL [56], and (5) SPR [93]. We chose these methods as
representative of inﬂuential algorithms within this benchmark. Since good performance on one game
can result in unduly high sample means without providing much information about performance on
other games, it is common to measure performance on Atari 100k using sample medians. Refer to
Appendix A.2 for more details about the experimental setup.
We investigate statistical variations in the few-run regime by evaluating 100 independent runs for
each algorithm, where the score for a run is the average returns obtained in 100 evaluation episodes
taking place after training. Each run corresponds to training one algorithm on each of the 26 games
in Atari 100k. This provides us with 26 × 100 scores per algorithm, which we then subsample with
replacement to 3–100 runs. The subsampled scores are then used to produce a collection of point
estimates whose statistical variability can be measured. We begin by using this experimental protocol
to highlight statistical concerns regarding median normalized scores.
High variability in reported results. Our ﬁrst observation is that the sample medians reported
in the literature exhibit substantial variability when viewed as random quantities that depend on a

standard ε-greedy parameters [14, Table 1] in ALE. See Appendix for more details.

small number of sample runs (Figure 2, left). This shows that there is a fairly large potential for
drawing erroneous conclusions based on point estimates alone. As a concrete example, our analysis
suggests that DER may in fact be better than OTR, unlike what the reported point estimates suggest.
We conclude that in the few-run regime, point estimates are unlikely to provide deﬁnitive answers to
the question: “Would we draw the same conclusions were we to re-evaluate our algorithm with a
different set of runs?”

Number of Runs (N)
Figure 3: Expected sample median of task means. The expected score for
N runs is computed by repeatedly subsampling N runs with replacement
out of 100 runs for 100,000 times.
Substantial bias in sample
medians. The sample median
is a biased estimator of the true
median: E[Median( ¯X1:M)]̸ =
Median(E[X1:M]) in general.
In the few-run regime, we ﬁnd
that this bias can dominate
the comparison between algo-
rithms, as evidenced in Fig-
ure 3. For example, the score difference between sample medians with 5 and 100 runs for SPR (+0.03
points) is about 36% of its mean improvement over DrQ(ε) (+0.08 points). Adding to the issue, the
magnitude and sign of this bias strongly depends on the algorithm being evaluated.
Statistical concerns cannot be satisfactorily addressed with few runs. While claiming improve-
ments with 3 or fewer runs may naturally raise eyebrows, folk wisdom in experimental RL suggests
that 20 or 30 runs are enough. By calculating 95% conﬁdence interval6 on sample medians for a
varying number of runs (Figure 2, right), we ﬁnd that this number is closer to 50–100 runs in Atari
100k – far too many to be computationally feasible for most research projects.
Consider a setting in which an algorithm is known to be better – what is the reliability of median and
IQM (Section 4.3) for accurately assessing performance differences as the number of runs varies?
Speciﬁcally, we consider two identical N-run experiments involving SPR, except that we artiﬁcially
inﬂate one of the experiments’ scores by a ﬁxed fraction or lift of +ℓ% (Figure 4). In particular, ℓ= 0
corresponds to running the same experiment twice but with different runs. We ﬁnd that statistically
defensible improvements with median scores is only achieved for 25 runs (ℓ= 25) and 100 runs
(ℓ= 10). With ℓ= 0, even 100 runs are insufﬁcient, with deviations of 20% possible.
Changes in evaluation protocols invalidates comparisons to prior work. A typical and relatively
safe approach for measuring the performance of an RL algorithm is to average the scores received
in their ﬁnal training episodes [69]. However, the ﬁeld has seen a number of alternative protocols
used, including reporting the maximum evaluation score achieved during training [1, 3, 75] or across
multiple runs [32, 47, 82]. A similar protocol is also used by CURL and SUNRISE [59] (Appendix A.4).
Results produced under alternative protocols involving maximum are generally incomparable with
end-performance reported results. On Atari 100k, we ﬁnd that the two protocols produce substantially
different results (Figure 5), of a magnitude greater than the actual difference in score. In particular,
evaluating DER with CURL’s protocol results in scores far above those reported for CURL. In other
words, this gap in evaluation procedures resulted in CURL being assessed as achieving a greater true
median than DER, where our experiment gives strong support to DER being superior. Similarly, we
ﬁnd that a lot of SUNRISE’s improvement over DER can be explained by the change in evaluation
protocol (Figure 5). Refer to Appendix A.4 for discussion on pitfalls of such alternative protocols.

Recommendations and Tools for Reliable Evaluation
Our case study shows that the increase in the number of runs required to address the statistical
uncertainty issues is typically infeasible for computationally demanding deep RL benchmarks. In this
section, we identify three tools for improving the quality of experimental reporting in the few-run
regime, all aligned with the principle of accounting for statistical uncertainty in results.
4.1
Stratiﬁed Bootstrap Conﬁdence Intervals
We ﬁrst reafﬁrm the importance of reporting interval estimates to indicate the range within which an
algorithm’s aggregate performance is believed to lie. Concretely, we propose using bootstrap CIs [29]
6Speciﬁcally, we use the m/n bootstrap [9] to calculate the interval between [2.5th, 97.5th] percentiles of
the distribution of sample medians (95% CIs).

Figure 6: Validating 95% Stratiﬁed Bootstrap
CIs for a varying number of runs for median and
IQM scores for DER. The true coverage % is com-
puted by sampling 10,000 sets of K runs without
replacement from 200 runs and checking the frac-
tion of 95% CIs that contains the true estimate
approximation based on 200 runs. Note that we
evaluate additional 100 runs for DER for an accu-
rate point estimate. Percentile CIs has the best
coverage while achieving a small width compared
to other methods. Also, CI widths for IQM are
much smaller than that of median. We also note
that with 3 runs, bootstrap CIs underestimate the
true 95% CIs and might require a larger nominal
coverage rate to achieve true 95% coverage.
with stratiﬁed sampling for aggregate performance, a method that can be applied to small sample
sizes and is better justiﬁed than reporting sample standard deviations in this context. While prior
work has recommended using bootstrap CIs for reporting uncertainty in single task mean scores with
N runs [16, 20, 41], this is less useful when N is small (Figure A.18), as bootstrapping assumes that
re-sampling from the data approximates sampling from the true distribution. We can do better by
aggregating samples across tasks, for a total of MN random samples.
To compute the stratiﬁed bootstrap CIs, we re-sample runs with replacement independently for
each task to construct an empirical bootstrap sample with N runs each for M tasks from which we
calculate a statistic and repeat this process many times to approximate the sampling distribution of
the statistic. We measure the reliability of this technique in Atari 100k for variable N, by comparing
the nominal coverage of 95% to the “true” coverage from the estimated CIs (Figure 6) for different
bootstrap methods (see [30] and Appendix A.5). We ﬁnd that percentile CIs provide good interval
estimates for as few as N = 10 runs for both median and IQM scores (Section 4.3).
4.2
Performance Proﬁles
Most deep RL benchmarks yield scores that vary widely between tasks and may be heavy-tailed,
multimodal, or possess outliers (e.g., Figure A.14). In this regime, both point estimates, such as
mean and median scores, and interval estimates of these quantities paint an incomplete picture of an
algorithm’s performance [24, Section 3]. Instead, we recommend the use of performance proﬁles [26],
commonly used in benchmarking optimization software. While performance proﬁles from Dolan
and Moré [26] correspond to empirical cumulative distribution functions without any uncertainty
estimates, proﬁles proposed herein visualize the empirical tail distribution function (Section 2) of a
random score (higher curve is better), with pointwise conﬁdence bands based on stratiﬁed bootstrap.
By representing the entire set of normalized scores x1:M,1:N visually, performance proﬁles reveal per-
formance variability across tasks much better than interval estimates of aggregate metrics. Although
tables containing per-task mean scores and standard deviations can reveal this variability, such tables
tend to be overwhelming for more than a few tasks.7 In addition, performance proﬁles are robust to
outlier runs and insensitive to small changes in performance across all tasks [26].
In this paper, we propose the use of a performance proﬁle we call run-score distributions or sim-
ply score distributions (Figure 7, right), particularly well-suited to the few-run regime. A score
distribution shows the fraction of runs above a certain normalized score and is given by
7In addition, standard deviations are sometimes omitted from tables due to space constraints.

bootstrap with stratiﬁed sampling. The proﬁles on the left are more robust to outliers and have smaller conﬁdence
bands. We use 10 runs to show the robustness of proﬁles with a few runs. For SimPLe [50], we use the 5 runs
from their reported results. The τ value where the proﬁles intersect y = 0.5 shows the median while for a
non-negative random variable, area under the performance proﬁle corresponds to the mean.

It is useful to contrast score distributions to average-score distributions, originally proposed in
the context of the ALE [5] as a generalization of the median score. Average-score distributions

X(τ) = ˆF(τ; ¯x1:M), which shows
the fraction of tasks on which an algorithm performs better than a certain score. However, such
distributions are a biased estimate of the thing they seek to represent. Run-score distributions
are more robust than average-score distributions, as they are a step function in 1/MN versus
1/M intervals, and typically has less variance: σ2

Performance proﬁles allow us to compare different methods at a
glance. If one curve is strictly above another, the better method
is said to stochastically dominate8 the other [27, 61]. In RL
benchmarks with a large number of tasks, however, stochastic
dominance is rarely observed: performance proﬁles often in-
tersect at multiple points. Finer quantitative comparisons must
therefore entail aggregate metrics.
We can extract a number of aggregate metrics from score dis-
tributions, including median (mixing runs and tasks) and mean
normalized scores (matching our usual deﬁnition). As we al-
ready argued that these metrics are deﬁcient, we now consider
interesting alternatives also derived from score distributions.
As an alternative to median, we recommend using the in-
terquartile mean (IQM). Also called 25% trimmed mean,
IQM discards the bottom and top 25% of the runs and cal-
culates the mean score of the remaining 50% runs (=⌊NM/2⌋for N runs each on M tasks). IQM
interpolates between mean and median across runs, which are 0% and almost 50% trimmed means
8A random variable X has stochastic dominance over random variable Y if P(X > τ) ≥P(Y > τ) for all
τ, and for some τ, P(X > τ) > P(Y > τ).

Optimality Gap
Human Normalized Score
Figure 9: Aggregate metrics on Atari 200M with 95% CIs based on 55 games with sticky actions [69]. Higher
mean, median and IQM scores and lower optimality gap are better. The CIs are estimated using the percentile
bootstrap with stratiﬁed sampling. IQM typically results in smaller CIs than median scores. Large values of
mean scores relative to median and IQM indicate being dominated by a few high performing tasks, for example,
DreamerV2 and M-IQN obtain normalized scores above 50 on the game JAMESBOND. Optimality gap is less
susceptible to outliers compared to mean scores. We compare DQN (Nature) [75], DQN with Adam optimizer,
C51 [6], REM [1], Rainbow [42], IQN [22], Munchausen-IQN (M-IQN) [109], and DreamerV2 [38]. All results
are based on 5 runs per game except for M-IQN and DreamerV2 which report results with 3 and 11 runs.
respectively. Compared to sample median, IQM is a better indicator of overall performance as it is
calculated using 50% of the combined runs while median only depends on the performance ordering
across tasks and not on the magnitude except at most 2 tasks. For example, zero scores on nearly half
of the tasks does not affect the median while IQM exhibits a severe degradation. Compared to mean,
IQM is robust to outliers, yet has considerably less bias than median (Figure A.17). While median is
more robust to outliers than IQM, this robustness comes at the expense of statistical efﬁciency, which
is crucial in the few-run regime: IQM results in much smaller CIs (Figure 2 (right) and 6) and is able
to detect a given improvement with far fewer runs (Figures 4 and A.15).
As a robust alternative to mean, we recommend using the optimality gap: the amount by which the
algorithm fails to meet a minimum score of γ = 1.0 (orange region in Figure 8). This assumes that a
score of 1.0 is a desirable target beyond which improvements are not very important, for example
when the aim is to obtain human-level performance [e.g., 3, 23]. Naturally, the threshold γ may be
chosen differently, which we discuss further in Appendix A.7.
If one is interested in knowing how robust an improvement from an algorithm X over an algorithm
Y is, another possible metric to consider is the average probability of improvement – this metric
shows how likely it is for X to outperform Y on a randomly selected task. Speciﬁcally, P(X >
Y ) =
1
M
PM
m=1 P(Xm > Ym), where P(Xm > Ym) (Equation A.2) is the probability that X is
better than Y on task m. Note that, unlike IQM and optimality gap, this metric does not account for
the size of improvement. While ﬁnding the best aggregate metric is still an open question and is often
dependent on underlying normalized score distribution, our proposed alternatives avoid the failure
modes of prevalent metrics while being robust and requiring fewer runs to reduce uncertainty.

Re-evaluating Evaluation on Deep RL Benchmarks
Arcade Learning Environment. Training RL agents for 200M frames on the ALE [5, 69] is the most
widely recognized benchmark in deep RL. We revisit some popular methods which demonstrated
progress on this benchmark and reveal discrepancies in their ﬁndings as a consequence of ignoring
the uncertainty in their results (Figure 9). For example, DreamerV2 [38] exhibits a large amount of
uncertainty in aggregate scores. While M-IQN [109] claimed better performance than Dopamine
Rainbow9 [42] in terms of median normalized scores, their interval estimates strikingly overlap.
Similarly, while C51 [5] is considered substantially better than DQN [75], the interval estimates as
well as performance proﬁles for DQN (Adam) and C51 overlap signiﬁcantly.
Figure 9 reveals an interesting limitation of aggregate metrics: depending on the choice of metric,
the ordering between algorithms changes (e.g., Median vs. IQM). The inconsistency in ranking
across aggregate metrics arises from the fact that such metrics only capture a speciﬁc aspect of
overall performance across tasks and runs. Additionally, the change of algorithm ranking between
optimality gap and IQM/median scores reveal that while recent algorithms typically show performance
gains relative to humans on average, their performance seems to be worse on games below human
9Dopamine Rainbow differs from that of Hessel et al. [42] by not including double DQN, dueling architecture
and noisy networks. Also, results in [42] were reported using a single run without sticky actions.

performance. Since performance proﬁles capture the full picture, they would often illustrate why
such inconsistencies exist. For example, optimality gap and IQM can be both read as areas in the
proﬁle (Figure 8). The performance proﬁle in Figure 10 (left) illustrates the nuances present when
comparing different algorithms. For example, IQN seems to be better than Rainbow for τ ≥2, but
worse for τ < 2. Similarly, the proﬁles of DreamerV2 and M-IQN for τ < 8 intersect at multiple
points. To compare sample efﬁciency of the agents, we also present their IQM scores as a function of
number of frames in Figure 10 (right).
DeepMind Control Suite. Recent continuous control papers benchmark performance on 6 tasks
in DM Control [104] at 100k and 500k steps. Typically, such papers claim improvement based on
higher mean scores per task regardless of the variability in those scores. However, we ﬁnd that when
accounting for uncertainty in results, most algorithms do not consistently rank above algorithms they
claimed to improve upon (Figure 11c and 11b). Furthermore, there are huge overlaps in 95% CIs of
mean normalized scores for most algorithms (Figure 11a). These ﬁndings suggest that a lot of the
reported improvements are spurious, resulting from randomness in the experimental protocol.
Procgen benchmark. Procgen [18] is a popular benchmark, consisting of 16 diverse tasks, for
evaluating generalization in RL. Recent papers report mean PPO-normalized scores on this benchmark
to emphasize the gains relative to PPO [92] as most methods are built on top of it. However,
Figure 12 (left) shows that PPO-normalized scores typically have a heavy-tailed distribution making
the mean scores highly dependent on performance on a small fraction of tasks. Instead, we recommend
using normalization based on the estimated minimum and maximum scores on ProcGen [18] and
reporting aggregate metrics based on such scores (Figure A.32). While publications sometimes make
binary claims about whether they improve over prior methods, such improvements are inherently
probabilistic. To reveal this discrepancy, we investigate the following question: “What is the

probability that an algorithm which claimed improvement over a prior algorithm performs better than
it?” (Figure 12, right). While this probability does not distinguish between two algorithms which
uniformly improve on all tasks by 1% and 100%, it does highlight how likely an improvement is. For
example, there is only a 40 −50% chance that UCB-DrAC [81] improves upon PLR [48]. We note
that a number of improvements reported in the existing literature are only 50 −70% likely.

Discussion
We saw, both in our case study on the Atari 100k benchmark and with our analysis of other widely-used
RL benchmarks, that statistical issues can have a sizeable inﬂuence on reported results, in particular
when point estimates are used or evaluation protocols are not kept constant within comparisons.
Despite earlier calls for more experimental rigor in deep RL [16, 20, 21, 41, 49, 83] (discussed in
Appendix A.3), our analysis shows that the ﬁeld has not yet found sure footing in this regards.
In part, this is because the issue of reproducibility is a complex one; where our work is concerned
with our conﬁdence about and interpretation of reported results (what Goodman et al. [34] calls
results reproducibility), others [79] have highlighted that there might be missing information about
the experiments themselves (methods reproducibility). We remark that the problem is not solved by
ﬁxing random seeds, as has sometimes been proposed [52, 77], since it does not really address the
question of whether an algorithm would perform well under similar conditions but with different
seeds. Furthermore, ﬁxed seeds might beneﬁt certain algorithms more than others. Nor can the
problem be solved by the use of dichotomous statistical signiﬁcance tests, as discussed in Section 2.
One way to minimize the risks associated with statistical effects is to report results in a more complete
fashion, paying close attention to bias and uncertainty within these estimates. To this end, our
recommendations are summarized in Table 1. To further support RL researchers in this endeavour, we
released an easy-to-use Python library, rliable along with a Colab notebook for implementing our
recommendations, as well as all the individual runs used in our experiments10. Again, we emphasize
the importance of published papers providing results for all runs to allow for future statistical analyses.
A barrier to adoption of evaluation protocols proposed in this work, and more generally, rigorous
evaluation, is whether there are clear incentives for researchers to do so, as more rigor generally
entails more nuanced and tempered claims. Arguably, doing good and reproducible science is one
such incentive. We hope that our ﬁndings about erroneous conclusions in published papers would
encourage researchers to avoid fooling themselves, even if that requires tempered claims. That said, a
more pragmatic incentive would be if conferences and reviewers required more rigorous evaluation
for publication, e.g., NeurIPS 2021 checklist asks whether error bars are reported. Moving towards
reliable evaluation is an ongoing process and we believe that this paper would greatly beneﬁt it.
Given the substantial inﬂuence of statistical considerations in experiments involving 40-year old Atari
2600 video games and low-DOF robotic simulations, we argue that it is unlikely that an increase in
available computation will resolve the problem for the future generation of RL benchmarks. Instead,
just as a well-prepared rock-climber can skirt the edge of the steepest precipices, it seems likely that
ongoing progress in reinforcement learning will require greater experimental discipline.

Societal Impacts
This paper calls for statistical sophistication in deep RL research by accounting for statistical
uncertainty in reported results. However, statistical sophistication can introduce new forms of
statistical abuses and monitoring the literature for such abuses should be an ongoing priority for the
research community. Moving towards reliable evaluation and reproducible research is an ongoing
process and this paper only partly addresses it by providing tools for more reliable evaluation. That
said, while accounting for uncertainty in results is not a panacea, it provides a strong foundation for
trustworthy results on which the community can build upon, with increased conﬁdence. In terms
of broader societal impact of this work, we do not see any foreseeable strongly negative impacts.
However, this paper could positively impact society by constituting a step forwards in rigorous
few-run evaluation regime, which reduces computational burden on researchers and is “greener” than
evaluating a large number of runs.

Open-source notebook and data
Colab notebook for producing and analyzing performance proﬁles, robust aggregate metrics, and
interval estimates based on stratiﬁed bootstrap CIs, as well as replicating the results in the paper can
be found at bit.ly/statistical_precipice_colab.
Individual runs for Atari 100k. We released the 100 runs per game for each of the 6 algorithms in
the case study in a public cloud bucket at gs://rl-benchmark-data/atari_100k.
Individual runs for ALE, Procgen and DM Control. For ALE, we used the individual runs
from Dopamine [14] baselines except for DreamerV2 [38], REM [1] and M-IQN [109], for which
the individual run scores were obtained from the corresponding authors. We release all the indi-
vidual run scores as well as ﬁnal scores for ALE at gs://rl-benchmark-data/ALE. The Proc-
gen results were obtained from the authors of IDAAC [80] and MixReg [48] and are released at
gs://rl-benchmark-data/procgen. For DM Control11, all the runs were obtained from the
corresponding authors and are released at gs://rl-benchmark-data/dm_control.

Pearson Correlation Coefficient
Correlation in scores from 2 independent sets of 100 runs/game with same seeds
Figure A.13: Runs can be different from using ﬁxed random seeds. We ﬁnd that correlation between two
sets of 100 runs of DER on Atari 100k using the same set of random seeds, that is, using a ﬁxed random seed per
run for Python, NumPy and JAX, is quite small. Small values of correlation coefﬁcient highlight that ﬁxing
seeds does not ensure deterministic results due to non-determinism in GPUs. Similarly, setting random seed in
PyTorch ensures reproducibility only on the same hardware.
Code. Due to unavailability of open-source code for DER, and OTR for Atari 100k, we re-implemented
these algorithms using Dopamine [14], a reproducible deep RL framework. For CURL and SPR, we
used the open-source code released by the authors while for DrQ, we used the source-code obtained
from the authors. Our code for Atari 100k experiments is open-sourced as part of the Dopamine
library under the labs/atari_100k folder. We also released a JAX [13] implementation of the full
Rainbow [42] in Dopamine.
Hyperparameters. All algorithms build upon the Rainbow [42] architecture and we use the exact
same hyperparameters speciﬁed in the corresponding publication unless speciﬁed otherwise. Akin to
DrQ and SPR, we used n-step returns with n = 10 instead of n = 20 for DER. DrQ codebase uses
non-standard evaluation hyperparameters, such as a 5% probability of selecting random actions during
evaluation (ε-eval= 0.05). DrQ(ε) differs DrQ in terms of using standard ε-greedy parameters [14,
Table 1] including training ε decayed to 0.01 rather than 0.1 and evaluation ε set to 0.001 instead of
0.05. Refer to the gin conﬁgurations in labs/atari_100k/configs for more details.
11Dreamer [37] results on DM control, obtained from the corresponding author, are based on hyperparameters
tuned for sample-efﬁciency. Compared to the original paper [37], the actor-critic learning rates were increased to
3e −4, the amount of free bits to 1.5, the training frequency, and the amount of pre-training to 1k steps on 10k
randomly collected frames. The imagination horizon was decreased to 10.

scores of DER on 26 games in the Atari 100k benchmark. Each histogram plot is based on 100 runs per game.
For most games, the distributions are either skewed (e.g., KUNGFUMASTER), heavy-tailed (e.g., BANKHEIST,

Statistical Efﬁciency of
IQM. Efﬁciency of an estimator is typ-
ically measured in terms of its mean
squared error (MSE). We estimate MSE
for trimmed estimators with 10 runs by
subsampling 20,000 sets of 10 runs with
replacement from 100 runs.
Compute. For the case study on Atari 100k, we used Tesla P100 GPUs for all the runs. Each run
spanned about 3-5 hours depending on the algorithm, and we ran a total of 100 runs / game × 26
games/algorithm × 6 algorithms = 15,600 runs. Additionally, we ran an additional 100 runs per game
for DER to compute a good approximation of point estimates for aggregate scores, which increases
the total number of runs by 2600. Overall, we trained and evaluated 18,200 runs, which roughly
amounts to 2400 days – 3600 days of GPU training.
Comparing performance of two algorithms. When conﬁdence intervals (CIs) overlap for two
random variables X and Y overlap, we estimate the 95% CIs for X −Y to account for uncertainty
in their difference (Figure A.15). For example, when using 5 runs, the median score improvement
from DrQ(ε) over DER is estimated to lie within (0.01, 0.21) while that of SPR over DrQ lies within
(−0.09, 0.18). Furthermore, while improvement from SPR over DER with 5 to 15 runs is not
statistically signiﬁcant, claiming “no improvement” would be misleading as evaluating more runs
indeed shows that the improvement is signiﬁcant.
Analyzing efﬁciency and bias of IQM. Theoretically, trimmed means, are known to have higher
statistical efﬁciency for mixed distributions and heavy-tailed distributions (Cauchy distribution), at
the cost of lower efﬁciency for some other less heavily-tailed distributions (normal distribution) than
mean, as shown by the seminal work of Tukey [106]. Empirically, on Atari 100k, IQM provides good
statistically efﬁciency among trimmed estimators across different algorithms (Figure A.16) as well as
has considerably small bias than median (c.f. Figure A.17 vs. Figure 3).

Related work on rigorous evaluation in deep RL
While prior work [41, 46, 68] highlights various reproducibility issues in policy-gradient methods,
this paper focuses speciﬁcally on the reliability of evaluation procedures on RL benchmarks and
provides an extensive analysis on common deep RL algorithms on widely-used benchmarks.
For more rigorous performance comparisons on a single RL task, Colas et al. [21], Henderson
et al. [41] provide guidelines for statistical signiﬁcance testing while Colas et al. [20] focuses on
determining the minimum number of runs needed for such comparisons to be statistically signiﬁcant.
Instead, this paper focuses on reliable comparisons on a suite of tasks and mainly recommends
reporting stratiﬁed bootstrap CIs due to the dichotomous nature and wide misinterpretation of
statistical signiﬁcance tests (see Remark in Section 2). Colas et al. [20, 21], Henderson et al. [41]
also discuss bootstrap CIs but for reporting single task mean scores – however, 3-5 runs is a small
sample size for bootstrapping: on Atari 100k, for achieving true coverage close to 95%, such CIs
require at least 20-30 runs per task (Figure A.18) as opposed to 5-10 runs for stratiﬁed bootstrap CIs
for aggregate metrics like median, mean and IQM (Figure A.19).
Chan et al. [16] propose metrics to measure the reliability of RL algorithms in terms of their stability
during training and their variability and risk in returns across multiple episodes. While this paper
focuses on reliability of evaluation itself, performance proﬁles showing the tail distribution of episodic
returns, applicable for even a single task with multiple runs, can be useful for measuring reliability of
an algorithm’s performance.
Jordan et al. [49] propose a game-theoretic evaluation procedure for “complete” algorithms that do
not require any hyperparameter tuning and recommend evaluating between 1,000 to 10,000 runs
per task to detect statistically signiﬁcant results. Instead, this work focuses on reliably evaluating
performance obtained after the hyperparameter tuning phase, even with just a handful of runs. That
said, run-score distributions based on runs with different hyperparameter conﬁgurations might reveal
sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning.
An alternative to score distributions, proposed by Recht [83], is to replace scores in a performance
proﬁle [26] by the probability that average task scores of a given method outperforms the best
method (among a given set of methods), computed using the Welsh’s t-test [113]. However, this
proﬁle is (1) also a biased estimate, (2) less robust to outlier runs, (3) is insensitive to the size of
performance differences, i.e., two methods that are uniformly 1% and 100% worse than the best
method are assigned the same probability, (4) is only sensible when task score distributions are
Gaussian, as required by Welsh’s t-test, and ﬁnally, (5) the ranking of methods depends on the speciﬁc
set of methods being compared in such proﬁles.
A.4
Non-standard Evaluation Protocols Involving Maximum
Even when adequate number of runs are used, the use of non-standard evaluation protocols can result
in misleading comparisons. Such protocols commonly involve the insertion of a maximum operation
inside evaluation, across or within runs, leading to a positive bias in reported scores compared to the
standard approach without the maximum.
One seemingly reasonable but faulty argument [10] for maximum across runs is that in a real-world
application, one might wish to run an stochastic algorithm A for N runs and then select the best
result. However, in this case, we are not discussing A but another algorithm AN, which evaluates N

random runs of A. If we are interested in AN, taking maximum over N runs only considers a single
run of AN. Since AN is itself stochastic, proper experimental methodology requires multiple runs
of AN. Furthermore, because learning curves are not in general monotonic, results produced under
the maximum-during-training protocol are in general incomparable with end-performance reported
results. In addition, such protocols introduces an additional source of positive statistical bias, since
the maximum of a set of random variables is a biased estimate of their true maximum.
On Atari 100k, CURL [56] and SUNRISE [59] used non-standard evaluation protocols. CURL reported
the maximum performance over 10 different evaluations during training. As a result, natural variability
in both evaluation itself and in the agent’s performance during training contribute to overestimation.
Applying the same procedure to CURL’s baseline DER leads to scores far above those reported for
CURL (Figure 5, “DER (CURL’s protocol)”). In the case of SUNRISE, the maximum was taken over
eight hyperparameter conﬁgurations separately for each game, with three runs each. We simulate
this procedure for DER (also SUNRISE’s baseline), using a dummy hyperparameter. We ﬁnd that
a lot of SUNRISE’s improvement over DER can be explained by this evaluation scheme (Figure 5,
“DER (SUNRISE’s protocol)”).

this process a numerous to create the bootstrap distribution over θ∗. In this paper, we evaluate the
following non-parametric methods for constructing CIs for θ using this bootstrap distribution:
1. Basic bootstrap, also known as the reverse percentile interval, uses the empirical quantiles
from the bootstrap distribution of the parameter bδ = ˆθ −θ for deﬁning the α × 100% CI:
(2bθ −θ∗
(α/2), 2bθ −θ∗
(1−α/2)), where θ∗
(1−α/2) denotes the 1−α/2 percentile of the bootstrapped
parameters θ∗and bθ is the empirical estimate of the parameter based on ﬁnite samples.
2. Percentile bootstrap. The percentile bootstrap proceeds in a similar way to the basic bootstrap,
using percentiles of the bootstrap distribution, but with a different formula: (θ∗
(1−α/2), θ∗
(α/2))
for deﬁning the α × 100% CI.
3. Bias-corrected (bc) bootstrap – adjusts for bias in the bootstrap distribution.
4. Bias-corrected and accelerated (bca) bootstrap, by Efron [29], adjusts for both bias and skew-
ness in the bootstrap distribution. This approach is typically considered to be more accurate
and has better asymptotic properties. However, we ﬁnd that it is not as effective as percentile
methods in the few-run deep RL regime.
More technical details about bootstrap CIs can be found in [40]. We ﬁnd that bootstrap CIs for
mean scores per game (computed using N random samples) require many more runs than aggregate
scores (computed using MN random samples) for achieving true coverage close to the nominal
coverage of 95% (c.f. Figure A.18 vs. Figure A.19).
Number of bootstrap re-samples. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, for computing uncertainty estimates
using stratiﬁed bootstrap, we use 50,000 samples for aggregate metrics and 2000 samples for
pointwise conﬁdence bands and average probability of improvement. Using larger number of samples
then the above speciﬁed values might result in more accurate uncertainty estimates but would be
slower to compute.
Stratiﬁed bootstrap over tasks and runs12. With access to only 1-2 runs per task, stratiﬁed
bootstrapping can be done over tasks (Figure A.22), to answer the question: “If I repeat the experiment
with a different set of tasks, what performance an algorithm is I expected to get?” It shows the
sensitivity of the aggregate score to a given task and can also be viewed as an estimate of performance
if we had used a larger unknown population of tasks [e.g., 90, 94]. Compared to the interval estimates
in Figure 9, bootstraping over tasks results in much larger uncertainty due to high variations in
performance across different tasks (e.g., easy vs hard exploration tasks).

Aggregate metrics: Additional visualizations and details
Alternative aggregate metrics. Different aggregate metrics emphasize different characteristics and
no single metric would be sufﬁcient for evaluating progress. While score distributions provide a full
picture of evaluation results, we provide suggestions for alternative aggregate metrics to highlight
other important aspects of performance across different tasks and runs.
• Difﬁculty Progress: One might be more interested in evaluating progress on the hardest
tasks on a benchmark [3]. In addition to optimality gap which emphasizes all tasks below a
certain performance level, a possible aggregate measure to consider is the mean scores of
the bottom 25% of the runs (Figure A.25, left), which we call Difﬁculty Progress (DP-25).
• Superhuman Probability: We also recommend reporting probability of being superhuman,
P(X > 1), given by the number of runs above average human performance (Figure A.25,
right) instead of number of games above average human performance [42, 93], a commonly
used metric on ALE.

Choice of γ for optimality gap. When using min-max normalized scores or human-normalized
scores, setting a score threshold of γ = 1 is sensible as it considers performance on games below
maximum performance or human performance respectively. If there is no preference for a speciﬁc
threshold, an alternative is to consider a curve of optimality gap as the threshold is varied, as shown
in Figure A.26, which shows how far from optimality an algorithm is given any threshold – a small
value of optimality gaps for all achievable score thresholds is desirable.
Probability of improvement. To compute the probability of improvement for a task m for algorithms

Figure A.29: Average Probability of Improvement on Atari 100k. Each subplot shows the probability of
improvement of a given algorithm compared to all other algorithms. The interval estimates are based on stratiﬁed
bootstrap with independent sampling with 2000 bootstrap re-samples.
for Atari 100k and ALE in Figure A.29 and Figure A.28. These estimates show how likely an
algorithm improves upon another algorithm.
Aggregate metrics on Atari 100k, Procgen and DM Control as well as ranking on individual tasks
on DM Control are visualized in Figures A.30–A.33.

Human Normalized Score
Figure A.30: Aggregate metrics on Atari 100k based on 26 games with 95% CIs. Higher mean, median and
IQM scores and lower optimality gap are better. The CIs are estimated using the percentile bootstrap with
stratiﬁed sampling. All results are based on 10 runs per game except SimPLe, for which we use the 5 runs from
their reported results. IQM results in smaller CIs than median scores while optimality gap results in smaller CIs
than mean scores. Mean scores are higher than IQM and median scores, indicating that they might be dominated
by performance on outlier tasks.

Figure A.31: Aggregate metrics on DM Control based on 6 tasks with 95% CIs. Higher mean, median and
IQM scores and lower optimality gap are better. The CIs are estimated using the percentile bootstrap with
stratiﬁed sampling with 50,000 bootstrap resamples. All results are based on 10 runs per game. All scores are
bounded above by 1, so 1 - optimality gap corresponds to mean scores.

Min-Max Normalized Score
(b) Aggregate metrics based on min-max normalized scores. IQM results in smaller CIs than median
scores. With min-max normalization, scores are below 1, so optimality gap corresponds to 1 - mean scores.
Figure A.32: Aggregate metrics on Procgen based on 16 tasks with 95% CIs. Higher mean, median and IQM
scores and lower optimality gap are better. The CIs are estimated using the percentile bootstrap with stratiﬁed
sampling with 50,000 bootstrap resamples. We compare PPO [92], MixReg [111], UCB-DrAC [81], PLR [48],
PPG [19] and IDAAC [80]. All results are based on 10 runs per game.

(b) 500k step benchmark.
Figure A.33: Ranking on individual tasks on DM Control 100k and 500k step benchmark. The ith column
in the rank distribution plots show the probability that a given method is assigned rank i, when compared to
other methods. These distributions are estimated using stratiﬁed bootstrap with 200,000 repetitions. We observe
that no single algorithm consistently ranks above other algorithms on all tasks, making comparisons difﬁcult
without aggregating results across tasks.
